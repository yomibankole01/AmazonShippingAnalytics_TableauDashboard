# Amazon Trade Shipping Dashboard

Amazon Trade is a global company specializing in the shipment of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) worldwide.

The Shipping Manager currently lacks visibility into the monthly order processing and shipping statistics. To address this, a dashboard is proposed, allowing the Shipping Manager to select a specific month and obtain detailed information on outstanding orders, including their daily status and corresponding shipping destinations.

## Data Sources

Amazon Trade maintains databases on both Azure and MariaDB. The Shipping Manager has provided the necessary details for connecting to these databases.

### MariaDB Connection Details

- **Server:** relational.fit.cvut.cz
- **Database:** [Your Database Name]
- **Port:** 3306
- **Username:** guest
- **Password:** relational

If the connection to MariaDB encounters issues, alternative data sources are available in the form of CSV files, which have been uploaded for your convenience.

Feel free to use this information to create a comprehensive and user-friendly shipping dashboard for the Shipping Manager.
